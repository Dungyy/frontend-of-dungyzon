## About <a name = "about"></a>
Welcome! This project is an Amazon clone created with ReactJS and custom CSS for the frontend, while using Node.js and Express.js for the backend API. The frontend features a search bar that enables users to search for products and showcases product details such as images, ratings, and prices within card components. The backend API manages search requests, delivering relevant product data to the frontend. This project emulates some of Amazon's core features and offers a chance to develop a full-stack application using widely-used web development technologies.
